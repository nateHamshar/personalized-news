# Here is your **Personalized News Feed**!

The idea of this project is to retrieve news articles about topics that are interesting for you

## The idea of this project is simple
First you will be asked to enter three topics that you enjoy.

Next, it will retrieve your tailored news feed from The News API.

Then all you have to do is read through them!

## No Sign up required!
Your interests will be saved to your local storage, so whenever you want to find something to read they will be ready for you.

But, if you want to change your interests, you can do that too!


### Tech Stack
This project is built with Next.js. This is strictly a client-side app, so using Next may be a bit overkill. 

Hosted on Vercel, the company behind Next.

I used [The News API](https://www.thenewsapi.com/) to retrieve the articles.

Design and Styles from me, hopefully it doesn't look too bad :)
Stole some codepen styles to try and make it look decent, credit where its due.
